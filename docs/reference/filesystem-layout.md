# Filesystem Layout

Sphinx Theme Builder requires the themes to follow a fairly specific
project layout and structure. This standard structure is what allows
this tool to provide a sensible build pipeline, which in-turn enables
all the nice quality-of-life things like `stb serve`.

## How it looks

```yaml
- README.md
- LICENSE
- package.json # For Javascript-based build tooling.
- pyproject.toml # For Python package metadata and tooling.
- src:
    - my_amazing_theme: # The importable Python package (notice underscores)
        - __init__.py
        - [other Python files]
        - theme: # HTML templates
            - my-amazing-theme:
                - [various .html pages]
                - theme.conf
        - assets: # Static assets, SASS and JS.
            - [static assets, possibly within folders]
            - styles:
                - index.sass # Compiled into the final CSS file.
                - [other Sass / SCSS files]
            - scripts:
                - my-amazing-theme.js # Compiled into the final JS file.
                - [other JS files]
```

## What is needed

This section describes what needs to be done in the various files in the
skeleton of the project. These are things that are checked when
performing the build, unless otherwise noted.

Flesh this out.
